# Example subsystem classes to build your own off of

arm subsystem example

TOPICS EXPLAINED IN ELEVATOR EXAMPLE HAVE BEEN OMITTED
- please understand the elevator example first, comments there are much more abundant and in detail.

if you are reading all the comments, I would reccomend going from

Arm.java -> sim/ArmSim.java -> real/ArmReal.java

if there are any imports you are confused about, Ctrl + Left Click on them, and
it will take you to the class it was declared in. There will be more comments
there explaining why those are there.
